## Difference between SQLMiner and SQLParser:
 - SQLMiner is meant to pull out data from well-structured SQL dumps, complete with `CREATE TABLE` statements and/or `INSERT INTO` statements that have column headings defined, allowing for schema extraction
 - SQLParser is geared towards files that have already been reduces and trimmed out, leaving only the statements that contain the data, having to infer what information is useful and ignoring the rest (e.g. extra characters like `(`, `)`, quotes, and so on)
